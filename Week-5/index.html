          <p>Needless to say, my hobbies definitely have an interesting variety.
             I enjoy boating every summer with my family on our local lake doing water sports
             such as wake boarding and knee boarding. I also enjoy doing CrossFit as my
             main source of exercise and competitition, however in the Winter I have recently
             fallen in love with snowboarding as of two years ago, so I try and embrace each
             season here in Michigan because of that :). </p>
