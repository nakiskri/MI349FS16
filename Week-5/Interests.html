  <p>My interests definitely vary for my Media and Information major. When I started
    going to college as a freshman I was actually undecided until my Sophomore year,
    and decided to go with Information Technology, so I was originally going for that
    until I transferred to Michigan State University and I guess Information Technology
    (and with all the classes and credits I had) transferred over as Media and Information
    here at MSU, but since the Media and Information major has such a broad spectrum I
      to figure out what topics/subjects in this major I was interested in.
      One of them obviously was web design because I actually started to play around with HTML when I was
      younger just for fun! Then I was introduced to Cybersecurity a few years back that my
      grandpa had told me about and this job field already seemed cool to me from the start
      and I'm always looking to learn more about it in case I might actually want a job doing
      Cybersecurity :).</p>
