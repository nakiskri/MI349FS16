      <h5>Section 2</h5>
      <p>The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under
      this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which
      shall be made, under their Authority; to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other
      public Ministers and Consuls; to all Cases of admiralty and maritime
      Jurisdiction; to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; to
      Controversies between two or more States; between a State and Citizens of
      another State; between Citizens of different States; between Citizens of the
      same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a
      State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.

      In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and
      those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original
      Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall
      have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and
      under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.

      The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and
      such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been
      committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such
      Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.</p>
