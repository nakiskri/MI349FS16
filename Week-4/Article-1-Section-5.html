      <h5>Section 5</h5>
      <p>Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of
      its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do
      Business; but a smaller number may adjourn from day to day, and may be
      authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and
      under such Penalties as each House may provide.

      Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for
      disorderly Behavior, and, with the Concurrence of two-thirds, expel a Member.

      Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time
      publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require
      Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question
      shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.

      Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of
      the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that
      in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</p>
