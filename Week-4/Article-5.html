      <p>The Congress, whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall
      propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the
      Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for
      proposing Amendments, which, in either Case, shall be valid to all Intents and
      Purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of
      three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths
      thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the
      Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One
      thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and
      fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State,
      without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.</p>
