      <h3>Article 6.</h3>

      <p>All Debts contracted and Engagements entered into, before the Adoption of this
      Constitution, shall be as valid against the United States under this
      Constitution, as under the Confederation.

      This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in
      Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the
      Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the
      Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or
      Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

      The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the
      several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers, both of
      the United States and of the several States, shall be bound by Oath or
      Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious Test shall ever be
      required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.</p>
