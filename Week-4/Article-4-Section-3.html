      <p>New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union; but no new States
      shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State; nor any
      State be formed by the Junction of two or more States, or parts of States,
      without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of
      the Congress.

      The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and
      Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United
      States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice
      any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.</p>
