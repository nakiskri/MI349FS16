      <h5>Section 2</h5>
      <p>The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United
      States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual
      Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the
      principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any subject
      relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to
      Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in
      Cases of Impeachment.

      He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make
      Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall
      nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint
      Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court,
      and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein
      otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress
      may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think
      proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of
      Departments.

      The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during
      the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End
      of their next Session.</p>
